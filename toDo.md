Currently working on:
* Set up main Past Workouts view and calendar
    * set up updates to data on submit or deletion of data
* create workout view when viewing past workout
List of things I need to do:
* handle case where user has no workouts stored yet or no exercise instances of exercise type yet
* fix number input for set controls
* add refresh state to trigger refresh

List of features to add:

* create view when trying to serach for a past exercise instance
* set up MMKV for bellow vvv
* add exercise/variant tab after doing above ^^^
* add some settings with MMKV

List of nice-to-haves to add:
* implement "days since last workout" (check most recent workout instance and do date math)
* get app icon and open screen to work
* when adding new set to exercise, copy over weight and modifiers (unilat, etc.)
