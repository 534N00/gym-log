Currently working on:
* options store stuff for storing lists of variants and exercises which AutoCompletes use and is also used by flatlist

List of things I need to do:
* handle case where user has no workouts stored yet or no exercise instances of exercise type yet

List of features to add:
* add some settings with MMKV

List of nice-to-haves to add:
* create view when trying to serach for a past exercise instance
* implement "days since last workout" (check most recent workout instance and do date math)
* get app icon and open screen to work
* when adding new set to exercise, copy over weight and modifiers (unilat, etc.)
