Currently working on:
* initial Android Play Store publishing

Refactoring possibilities:
* Create button component(s) with type (for color) and width props
* Create horizontal rule component with width as prop
* Replace get rid of pastWorkoutStore and switch to using StatelessExerciseTiles unless adding mutability to past workouts

List of nice-to-haves that can be added:
* flesh out iOS functionality
* toast/messages for when users successfully or failingly perform certain actions
* create a nice expo snack to better show off this repository
* make setting for user to change base and accent colors
* create dark mode/lightmode
* data import
* doing workout tags rather than tag colors (can be tags associated with colors to give abreviated look)
