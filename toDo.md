Currently working on:
* adding autocomplete search for past exercises by name or primary muscle
* also adding for new exercise input the primary muscle hit
* settings screen
* add some settings with MMKV (user name)

List of things I need to do:
* paginate the user's calendar pulls or just load all of them (could be in hundreds)
* add haptics to pressables

List of features to add:
* import CSV
* export to CSV

List of nice-to-haves to add:
* create view when trying to serach for a past exercise instance
* implement "days since last workout" (check most recent workout instance and do date math)
* get app icon and open screen to work
* when adding new set to exercise, copy over weight and modifiers (unilat, etc.)
* make setting for user to change base and accent colors
* create dark mode/lightmode
